    <h2>Alfredo Affair: Tempting Creamy Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo</h2>

    <p class="fettuccine-para">A traditional Italian-American pasta dish, Creamy Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo is renowned for its deep, decadent flavor. 
        It has fettuccine noodles mixed with seasoned, soft chicken chunks and covered in a smooth Alfredo sauce. 
        The sauce has a thick, creamy texture that sticks to the pasta since it's made with butter, heavy milk, and Parmesan cheese. 
        This meal, which is frequently topped with more cheese and fresh parsley, has a delicious combination of cheesy, salty, and creamy flavors. 
        Creamy Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo is a favorite in many homes and restaurants because of its reassuring and fulfilling properties. 
        It's ideal for a special event or a private evening.

    <h3>Steps to Perfect Creamy Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo</h3>
    <ol class="fettuccine-steps">
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. 
            Add chicken, 1/2 of the garlic, and Italian seasoning. 
            Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). 
            Remove from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. 
            Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter in the skillet. 
            Add onion, mushrooms, and remaining garlic; sauté until onion is transparent, about 5 minutes. 
            Stir in flour, salt, and pepper; cook for 2 minutes. 
            Slowly add milk and half-and-half; cook and stir until smooth and creamy. 
            Stir in both cheeses until melted.</li>

        <li>Stir in chicken mixture, tomatoes, and sour cream. Serve over cooked fettuccine.</li>
