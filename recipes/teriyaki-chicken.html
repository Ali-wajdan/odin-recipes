    <h2>The Inception</h2>
    <p> A contemporary take on the traditional Japanese meal teriyaki chicken is baked teriyaki chicken. 
        It became popular as a low-fat cooking method that catered to consumers who were health-conscious and wanted a healthier option than the conventional grilled or pan-fried variants. 
        The sauce, which is usually made of soy sauce, mirin, sugar, and occasionally sake, is what gives teriyaki dishes their distinctive sweet-savory flavors. 
        To make the dish, just cover chicken pieces in the sauce and bake them in the oven until they become soft and caramelized. 
        By using this technique, you not only use less oil but also give the chicken more time to fully absorb the spices.
        Because of its delectable flavor, simplicity of preparation, and capacity to satiate appetites for excellent yet nutritious meals, baked teriyaki chicken has become more popular throughout the world.
